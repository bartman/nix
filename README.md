# my NixOS / home-manager config

Initial notes on how I converted my Raspbery Pi 5 with Debian 12 to use Nix:

# how to use this

```sh
git clone git@github.com:bartman/nix.git ~/nix
home-manager switch --flake ~/nix#bart
```
NOTE: you should replace my name ("Bart") with your name in all these files, if you want to use this.
